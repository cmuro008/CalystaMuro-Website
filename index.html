        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currerntly a full time student at UC Riverside as a first-year Pre-Business major. I am involved with the UCR Navigators and Trio Scholars at UCR. In high school , I have been involved in clubs such as Key Club and Interact Club. They are both community service clubs that volunteer at events in our community. Interact Club primarily serves Montebello and emphasizes forming relations with students. Key Club promotes leadership along with character among students while giving back to the community. These clubs have taught me how to form a network and socialize with others. I learned how rewarding volunteering is and the importance of putting service above yourself. In Key Club, I obtained leadership positions such as Secretary of Hours, Vice President, and President. As Secretary of Hours, I had to record the number of hours a member would receive for attending events. Having this position, I spent countless hours calculating information and keeping this information organized. At the end of sophomore year, I was elected Vice President in which I assisted the cabinet’s needs. I attended almost every event and expanded my knowledge about Key Club by researching online and communicating with other people who had experience in the club. By this time, I felt an immense passion for serving both my community along with the club and the need to keep the club successful. I had become President of Key Club at the end of junior year and I applied everything I learned in my previous positions to the club. Outside of school, I volunteered at my local church for their vacation bible school program where I participated as a teacher during summer and winter. During the four weeks in the summer, I had to prepare and lead lessons along with activities for the children. I supervised the children’s behavior during breaks, lunch, and field trips. In the winter, I spent a week in the programming leading discussions and participated in activities for the children. I also assisted my co-workers and cleaned the facility at the end of the day.
<br><br>

        Personal growth and giving back to the community are two important concepts for me. I want to grow by challenging myself and learning new concepts. I believe college education is the door to providing me with the future I want. As a first year I am planning to take advantage of each internship and organization I am involved in.  For me to be successful in my career, I have to go to college and have on-hands experience. Besides academics, going to college will allow me to extend my network and meet people from different backgrounds.<br><br>

        My goal is to manage a company or be part of a big organization that will benefit people and allow me to work with a team. I will major in business for four years at UC Riverside and then attend graduate school for my master’s degree. I am also planning to participate in many internships during college and I am looking forward to studying abroad. After I graduate, I would like to become a business operations manager to assist companies in reaching their full potential. Being a leader of a community organization such as a food bank or Kiwanis is also the intent of mine as I developed a passion for volunteering throughout high school. I learned that the reward is not the “thank you”, but a sense of a stronger community. Despite the obstacles I am faced with, I will always put my community and my education as my top priorities.
